# docker-python-node

Handy Docker containers with python and node installed securely to use as base Docker images for your application.

# How to Use

Select a Python version, select a Node version, and select an OS that suits your needs, and then pick the tag that includes those. Or, if you want to use the latest, just use `latest` in the place of the version string.

For example, to get Python 3.6.x and Node 8.x.x on Debian Stretch, use the tag `3.6-8-stretch` like so:

```
$ docker run airhorns/python-node:3.6-8-stretch python --version
```
